A Karnaugh map (K-map) solver in Java can efficiently minimize Boolean functions for 2-4 variables. Begin by representing the truth table in the code. For each variable count, create appropriate nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations. Implement logic to group adjacent cells with '1' values to form groups of 1s, 2s, or 4s. Then, merge adjacent groups to obtain prime implicants. Utilize algorithms like Quine-McCluskey or Petrick's method for further minimization. Develop methods to handle essential prime implicants and cover all '1' cells with the minimum number of terms. Finally, generate simplified Boolean expressions or truth tables as output. Ensure error handling for invalid inputs and provide clear documentation for usage.
